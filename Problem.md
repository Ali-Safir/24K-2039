ALGORITHM:

TASK 01 : Implement an algorithm for determining if an Nth is a divisor of an n Number (i.e. 2 is a divisor of 6).
If so, determine if it’s an even number or odd number as well.


1.Read two numbers “Nth” and “n” from the user.
2.Check if “n” is divisible by “Nth”  ( Nth % n == 0)
3.If “Nth” is divisor of “n’ 
4.THEN check if “Nth” is even or odd number. (If number is divisible by 2 its even, if not then odd)
5.Display whether “Nth” is a divisor of “n” and whether “Nth” is even or odd.
