ALGORITHM:

TASK 01 : Implement an algorithm for determining if an Nth is a divisor of an n Number (i.e. 2 is a divisor of 6).
If so, determine if it’s an even number or odd number as well.


1.Read two numbers “Nth” and “n” from the user.
2.Check if “n” is divisible by “Nth”  ( Nth % n == 0)
3.If “Nth” is divisor of “n’ 
4.THEN check if “Nth” is even or odd number. (If number is divisible by 2 its even, if not then odd)
5.Display whether “Nth” is a divisor of “n” and whether “Nth” is even or odd. 


TASK 03 : Implement an algorithm for making a simple calculator with all the operators (+,-,*,/,%)


1.Read two numbers and an operator from the user.
2.If the operator is “+”, add the two numbers.
3.If the operator is “-”, subtract the second number from the first number.
4.If the operator is “*”, multiply the two numbers.
5.If the operator is “/”, divide the first number by second number 
6.If the operator is “%”, calculate the remainder.
7.Display the result to the user.
